  Cut time per topic then cut topics
</h2>

Note:

But what happens if things don't go as planned? They linger at the zoo a little too long. Or you have too much content in the body of your presentation?
 
You'll want to cut the time spent per topic then cut the number of topics.

In other words, try to touch upon each topic at the same level of detail before removing topics.

Keeping the topics at the same level of detail (or granularity) will make the presentation more coherent and easier to follow.
