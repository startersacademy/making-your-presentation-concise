# Remove breadth

Note:

If you still run out of time, you can cut breadth. 

If it takes too long at the zoo and at Seaport Village and they might miss their flight, skip the Star of India.

Because you have done the most important things first, cutting the last stop is not as bad.

If your presentation has 3 main points, and you are running out of time, you can just not cover the third point.

Your audience may not even know that you were going to talk about it.
